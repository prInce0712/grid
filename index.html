      <p>“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a <br>
        transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up
        for <br> the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
        The next 12 <br> weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing
        the course, I’ve <br> successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”</p>

        gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present <br> myself as a capable
        junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get <br> the personal attention you need from

      <h4>Such a life-changing <br> experience. Highly <br> recommended!</h4>

      <p>“ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve <br> never written a line of code. I needed <br> some structure from
        professionals <br> who can help me learn programming <br>  step by step. I was encouraged to <br> enroll by a former
        student of theirs <br> who can only say wonderful things <br> about the program. The entire <br> curriculum and staff
        did not <br> disappoint. They were very hands-on <br> and I never had to wait long for <br> assistance. The agile team
        project, in <br> particular, was outstanding. It took <br> my learninbrg to the next level in a way <br> that no tutorial
        could ever have. In <br> fact, I’ve often referred to it during <br> interviews as an example of my <br> development
        experience. It certainly <br> helped me land a job as a full-stack <br> developer after receiving multiple <br> offers.
        100% recommend! ”</p>
